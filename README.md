# NFL Quarterback Performance Prediction

This repository contains an analysis of NFL quarterback performance and uses machine learning models to predict passer ratings.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the passer rating of NFL quarterbacks based on their historical performance data. Three different machine learning models are compared: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. The best model, based on the R-squared score and Mean Squared Error, is the Random Forest Regressor with an R-squared score of 0.95 and a Mean Squared Error of 90.96.
